        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am a current freshman at University of Riverside, California, studying business administration. I am interested in marketing! I am a confident, passionate and compassionate student at University of Riverside, California. Throughout my highschool career, I had various interests in careers, such as medicine, arts, and business. I loved exploring different careers throughout my years. I have worked as a cashier, nurse assistant, and an organization leader. To begin with, I was part of the Thirst Project organization to help raise money to build wells for clean, sanitary water in countries that donâ€™t have them. Being a leader of this club, I learnt to be assertive, responsible, and organized. I was also taught many skills like problem-solving and communicating through running this organization. Not only did I gain these skills, I also had to deal with money, so I was taught to be financially smart and responsible. This organization helped me learn I was the President at my highschool for this club. I worked at my local cityâ€™s hospital, as a nurse assistant; I helped with running papers, getting supplies, and delivering anything needed. I also worked at the front lobby, checked in visitors who came to the hospital, and guided them to where they needed to go. I also worked as a gift shop cashier. At the hospitalâ€™s gift shop, I helped customers, checked out what the customers were buying, and assisted anyone that came in for help. I worked closely with patients, cared for them, and helped them with their daily needs.Through this experience I learned to be patient, observant, and compassionate. Alongside volunteering at the hospital and running an organization at my highschool, I also taught dance at a dance studio. At the dance studio, I would teach students and dancers choreography. I would also critique students on their dance, and help them improve their dancing and help them with their skills. While teaching them, I learned how to be patient with kids, and teaching skills. I thoroughly enjoyed this job because of my passion for dance. Finally the summer before college started, I took a marketing course to gauge my interest for business and marketing. This course was an introductory course that taught students about how marketing was in the business field. I enjoyed this course very much, so I decided to pursue it as my profession. Throughout all these different experiences of different jobs and volunteering, I learned a lot of skills that I can apply to my future career, to be successful. In these many experiences, I found my true passion for marketing. All these different experiences taught me all aspects of marketing and different skills I can use in the business industry. I am someone who dreams big, has big goals to achieve,and works hard towards every goal, whether itâ€™s small or big. Even though in my high school years, I had very diverse experiences in different fields. Each skill I learned I can apply to my every life. All my experiences will help me be successful in the future.
